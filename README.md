# Project-24POINTS-CS program
I want to do a big online game system. There are a lot of different competitive game. People could win the money by winning the different games (kind of legal casino). 
STEPS
1. People could choose which games they are good at.
2. Choose how much money they want to wager
3. Connect with another online player
4. Game start.
5. Different game has different rules (I would like do 24 game)
6. They will be given the same numbers provided by the computer.
7. There will be a clock to judge who is faster.
8. Game will be absolutely equal and no one could cheat

In the two weeks, I would like to make a program about a small math game, called “24 Game”. The rule is that the player need to find a way to calculate four integers which would be provided by the system randomly (have to use all of them) so that the result is 24.
I will try to finish the “24 game” by using if/else statement.

Test:
1. The program will ask “Are you ready”
2. The user types “test”
The program will give you 4 numbers “1,2,3,4”, and assign them as a.b.c.d
3. If the reader types a*b*c*d since the result is 24, the program will type “Yes”
4. If the reader types a+b+c+d, since the result is 10, the program will type “No” and rerun the function to ask you to type again.
 
Real:
1. The program will ask “Are you ready”. Player type “Yes” to play the game
2. The program will provide 4 random numbers and assign each of them as a,b,c,d
3. The reader will use a,b,c,d to do the math and get 24.
4. If the reader get 24, the program will type “Nice”
5. If the reader failed, the program will rerun the function until the reader get the correct answer.
